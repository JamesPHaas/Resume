        <p class="box"> Having a varied work experience helps to grow one's perception of life and what it means to live. 
            I am now looking to settle into a life long career while working hard for you. Having done a lot of different jobs
            helps me to know what I want out of life. Things that I have done are;
            <ul><li>Working Breed to Wean on a Pig Farm</li>
            <li>Cleaning Hotel Rooms</li>
            <li>Working fast food</li>
            <li>Doing clericle work for a steel tubing warehouse</li>
            <li>Being a barista</li>

        <p class="body">Helping with customers, making drinks, and making sure that things are sanitary
            are a few of the responsibilities that I complete. I find that chatting with the customers 
            and making sure that I have the drink correct are very important.

        <p class="body">This is a small place that had been around since 1955. THe cookies, cakes, and bread were 
            baked with the greatest of care. What I did there was make one of their most popular products. The Kolachi,
        or Hungarian Roll, I also made sure that dishes were clean and sanitary and that the floors were clean. </p>

            <p class="body">I worked as a debt collector for a small while. Calling people and hearing their stories.
                It allowed me to speak to them and, in most cases, I would do whatever I could to facilitate and help.
