        <p class="box"> Having a varied work experience helps to grow one's perception of life and what it means to live. 
            I am now looking to settle into a life long career while working hard for you. Having done a lot of different jobs
            helps me to know what I want out of life. Things that I have done are;
            <ul><li>Working Breed to Wean on a Pig Farm</li>
            <li>Cleaning Hotel Rooms</li>
            <li>Working fast food</li>
            <li>Doing clericle work for a steel tubing warehouse</li>
            <li>Being a barista</li>
        </ul>
